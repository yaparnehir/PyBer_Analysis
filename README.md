# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
>In this project we were given a datasets which are in "Resources" folder. Pyber Company, ask us to analyze the ride share data among the cities and city types. Expected results asked to be seen visually by graphs and pivot tables. To begin with, we can categorized the steps as Purpose and Roadmap.
### Purpose
>Our purpose is to analyze and visualize the results to demonstrate and see the differences between city types among the weeks. This process include the timeline betweeen Januart to late April of 2019. 
### Roadmap
>Making a roadmap is easy to keep the track of project. In this project our roadmap can be listed by below.
>*Reading the csv files and checking the empty or wrong data
>*Getting the total rides,amounts,fares by the city types.
>*Working on a specific timeline and creating a new listings and dataframes
>*Visualize the results
## Process
>We worked with "python" language on "jupyter notebook" since it is easy to manipulate and demonstrate the result. By using the "Matplotlib" we create a better graphs rather than using the excel and matlab. Some challenges were occured related to merging dataframes. In order not to mix up data, even though working on a merged dataset is easy, in some cases we need to get the datas from the individual datasets.
