# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
>In this project we were given a datasets which are in "Resources" folder. Pyber Company, ask us to analyze the ride share data among the cities and city types. Expected results asked to be seen visually by graphs and pivot tables. To begin with, we can categorized the steps as Purpose and Roadmap.
### Purpose
>Our purpose is to analyze and visualize the results to demonstrate and see the differences between city types among the weeks. This process include the timeline betweeen Januart to late April of 2019. 
### Roadmap
>Making a roadmap is easy to keep the track of project. In this project our roadmap can be listed by below.
>*Reading the csv files and checking the empty or wrong data
>*Getting the total rides,amounts,fares by the city types.
>*Working on a specific timeline and creating a new listings and dataframes
>*Visualize the results
## Process
>We worked with "python" language on "jupyter notebook" since it is easy to manipulate and demonstrate the result. By using the "Matplotlib" we create a better graphs rather than using the excel and matlab. Some challenges were occured related to merging dataframes. In order not to mix up data, even though working on a merged dataset is easy, in some cases we need to get the datas from the individual datasets.
## Results
>![Analysis](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
On the graph above we can see the Urban city types far more efficient and beneficial than the other types. Also we can say that after the end of February rides number and fares are increased. In all the different types of cities, the changes are looks similar. On the other hand they all started to decreased at some point by the late times of April. 
>![Analysis2](/analysis/Fig6.png)
> Also seen above Urban cities has the most common one to use the ride-sharing app. It may quite easy to say that since there are too many riders, drivers and trips occured in Urban cities, Fares might be dropped than the less common cities. This conclusion can be seen also average fare pie graph.

## Summary
> Overall results are showed us that Urban cities has more rides and fares in general. Since the number is decreased and there are less drivers are stated in suburban and rural cities fares average can be differ. Also between January to late February rides were similar and not quite much but after this period it increased till the late of Aprils.
